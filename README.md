# Image Edge Detection + Blur + Median Filter
## Description
This repo contains my university task for digital signal processing. The task is to implement Laplacian edge detection 3x3 and 5x5, Sobel edge detection, box blur, Gaussian blur and median filter. Everything is implemented by means of image convolution.
